This project is intended to keep track of member participation in UC Berkeley surveillance testing. I don't want to pay or be liable for hosting your members' data, so I'm not offering it as a full service, however, you're all more than welcome to use the source code and host it yourselves.

There are still a few key things that should be done before deploying this webapp, particularly data encryption. I will update the source code as quickly as I can, and let you guys know once it is complete. 

I plan to make some pretty explicit instructions about configuring the app and deploying it, so I will share that once I complete it as well.

Making this app was a huge learning process for me, so there may be bugs and other issues with it. Feel free to report those to me or reach out with any questions. I have also only hosted it locally so far, so I have no guarantees that it will deploy easily.
